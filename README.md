why no readmeâ€½
documentation is essential to any project!

This can be a place holder for Project Nexus: A GoDot Project;

# Getting Started

## Arch Linux

I would assume the process is the same across any linux distribution and probably even Windows, or Mac.  Although zero testing has been allocated to mac functionality.
* Clone this project where you plan to work on it.
* Open Godot. Doing so should bring up the Project Manager.
* Find and press the import button, and select the ProjectNexus folder you just finished cloning
BADA BING BADA BOOM! you are up and running
